    "aboutMeSummary": "I‚Äôve always been fascinated by technology and computers. During high school, while I was taking a technical course, I had my first experience programming microcontrollers and working with low-level software. Even with that background, I ended up not pursuing a degree in technology and shifted to engineering. It was only two years later, in 2019, that I decided development and technology would be my professional path‚Äîand I haven‚Äôt regretted that choice since. üë®‚Äçüíª",
